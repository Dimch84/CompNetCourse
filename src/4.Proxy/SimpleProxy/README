Simple Proxy i a simple .Net web proxy, developed with VS 2010.

It is born from the need to allow applications to access an authenticated proxy without direct authentication.

In this case i would config SimpleProxy to use a parent proxy with username and password and then configure the client apps to use SimpleProxy.
It is also possible to insert some logging code between Request/Respose and to inspect the passing traffic.
It is also useful to do some logging or to debug webservices calls.

If you use any of this code please let me know if it is useful and give some credits (if possible).
